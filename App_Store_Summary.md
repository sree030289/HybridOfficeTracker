## Background Location Usage

### When We Access Location

**Foreground Access:**
- **Purpose**: Office proximity detection when user opens app
- **Frequency**: Only when user actively uses app while at office
- **Duration**: Single location check, immediately stopped
- **Example**: User opens app → detects office proximity → suggests "Mark as Office Day"

**Background Access (Smart Auto Mode Only):**
- **Purpose**: Automated attendance logging and productivity reminders
- **Schedule**: Maximum 3 times per weekday (10am, 1pm, 3pm)
- **Duration**: 3-5 seconds per check, then immediately stops
- **Intelligent Logic**: Skips all checks if user already logged attendance for the day

### Smart Daily Check Logic

```
Daily Background Process:
1. Check if user already logged attendance today
   - IF LOGGED: Skip all location checks for the day
   - IF NOT LOGGED: Perform brief location check to help with auto-logging

Result: Most days have 0-1 background checks instead of 3
```

**Real-World Examples:**

**Scenario A - Already Logged (Most Common):**
- 9:30 AM: User opens app → Auto-logs office attendance
- 10:00 AM: Background check → **SKIPPED** (already logged)
- 1:00 PM: Background check → **SKIPPED** (already logged)
- 3:00 PM: Background check → **SKIPPED** (already logged)

**Scenario B - Forgot to Log:**
- 10:00 AM: Background check → Detects office → Auto-logs attendance
- 1:00 PM: Background check → **SKIPPED** (now logged)
- 3:00 PM: Background check → **SKIPPED** (now logged)

**Scenario C - Manual Mode User:**
- All day: **ZERO background location access**
- Receives notification reminders to manually log attendance

### What We DON'T Do
❌ **No Continuous Tracking**: Never runs location services continuously  
❌ **No Location History**: No database of where users have been  
❌ **No Movement Tracking**: Don't track routes, speeds, or travel patterns  
❌ **No Always-On GPS**: Background access only during brief scheduled checks  
❌ **No Location Sharing**: Never transmit location data anywhere

## Privacy & Data Storage

### 100% Local Storage (No Backend)
- **All data stored locally** using device AsyncStorage
- **No server synchronization** - works completely offline
- **No user accounts** - no registration or login required
- **No analytics tracking** - no third-party data collection
- **No cloud backups** - data never leaves the device

### Complete User Control
1. **Opt-in Required**: Background location never enabled by default
2. **Easy Disable**: Switch to "Manual Entry" mode removes all location access instantly
3. **Alternative Mode**: Full app functionality available without any location permission
4. **Data Wipe**: Complete data deletion available in Settings

## Legitimate Business Use Cases

### 1. Hybrid Work Compliance
Many companies require employees to be in office 2-3 days/week. Our app helps users:
- Track actual vs required office days
- Meet company hybrid work policies
- Plan office days in advance
- Avoid attendance compliance issues

### 2. Automated Attendance Logging
Background location enables:
- Auto-detecting office arrival (saves daily manual logging)
- Preventing forgotten attendance entries
- Location-based check-in suggestions only when at office
- Maintaining accurate attendance records with minimal user effort

### 3. Productivity Analytics
Limited background access provides:
- Daily work summaries: "You worked from office 3/5 days this week"
- Context-aware productivity notifications
- Work pattern insights to optimize hybrid schedules
- Progress tracking toward monthly office day goals

---

## Technical Implementation

### Minimal Location Access Pattern
```
Background Check Process:
1. Scheduled notification fires (10am/1pm/3pm)
2. Check: Is attendance already logged today?
3. IF YES: Skip location entirely, send productivity notification
4. IF NO: Brief 3-5 second location check
5. Process office proximity (within 200m = office)
6. Auto-log if at office, or send manual reminder
7. Immediately stop location services
```

### Battery & Performance Optimization
- **Duration**: Maximum 15 seconds total per day (3 checks × 5 seconds)
- **Frequency**: Only on weekdays, never weekends/holidays
- **Geofencing**: Simple distance calculation, no complex region monitoring
- **Network**: No internet required for location processing
- **Background Refresh**: No continuous background app refresh needed

## App Store Compliance

### Why Background Location is Necessary
1. **User Convenience**: Eliminates daily manual logging friction for office workers
2. **Attendance Accuracy**: Prevents forgotten entries that affect compliance tracking
3. **Productivity Context**: Location-aware notifications provide relevant reminders
4. **Goal Achievement**: Helps users meet hybrid work requirements automatically

### Privacy Safeguards Implemented
✅ **Local-only processing** - no data transmission to servers  
✅ **User opt-in required** - not enabled by default, must choose "Smart Auto"  
✅ **Intelligent skipping** - no location access if already logged that day  
✅ **Easy disable** - one-tap switch to manual mode removes all location access  
✅ **Complete data control** - user can wipe all data anytime  
✅ **No location history** - only current proximity processed, not stored  
✅ **Offline capable** - works without internet connection  
✅ **Manual alternative** - identical functionality available without location  

### Clear Permission Messaging
iOS permission dialog explains exact usage:
> "OfficeTrack performs scheduled location checks (10am, 1pm, 3pm) to automatically log office attendance and send daily work summary notifications. Location data is processed locally and never shared. You can disable this anytime in Settings."

4. Zero location access throughout entire experience
