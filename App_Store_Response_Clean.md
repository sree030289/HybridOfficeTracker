##  Background Location Usage - Detailed Breakdown

### When We Access Location (Foreground & Background)

####  **Foreground Location Access**
**Purpose**: Office vicinity detection for manual check-ins
**Frequency**: Only when user opens app while at office
**Duration**: Single location check, immediately stopped
**Example**: User opens app at 9:30 AM  detects office proximity  suggests "Mark as Office Day"

####  **Background Location Access (Limited & Scheduled)**
**Purpose**: Productivity reminders and daily work summaries
**Frequency**: Exactly 3 times per day, only on weekdays
**Schedule**: 
- **10:00 AM**: Morning productivity check
- **1:00 PM**: Midday location summary  
- **3:00 PM**: Afternoon work pattern analysis

**Duration**: ~5 seconds per check, then immediately stops
**Data**: Only processes current location, no tracking history stored

### What We DON'T Do
 **No Continuous Tracking**: Never runs location services continuously  
 **No Location History**: No database of where users have been  
 **No Movement Tracking**: Don't track routes, speeds, or travel patterns  
 **No Always-On GPS**: Background access only during 3 scheduled daily checks  
 **No Location Sharing**: Never transmit location data to servers

##  Technical Implementation

### Smart Location Access Pattern
```javascript
// Background location with intelligent daily check
10:00 AM Notification Trigger  
  Check if already logged today  
  IF NOT LOGGED: Check current location (3-5 sec)  Process office proximity  Auto-log if at office
  IF ALREADY LOGGED: Skip location check entirely  Send productivity summary
  Stop location services

1:00 PM Notification Trigger  
  Check if already logged today  
  IF NOT LOGGED: Check location  Send reminder to log manually
  IF ALREADY LOGGED: Skip location check  Send midday summary
  Stop location services  

3:00 PM Notification Trigger  
  Check if already logged today  
  IF NOT LOGGED: Check location  Send final reminder
  IF ALREADY LOGGED: Skip location check  Send end-day summary
  Stop location services
```

### No Continuous Tracking
- Location services activate only during the 3 scheduled checks
- No background app refresh for location
- No significant location change monitoring
- No region monitoring or geofences running continuously
